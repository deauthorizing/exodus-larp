# exodus-larp

A userscript to LARP your balance on Exodus - leaked by wish and fusi, originally used by justin.sol #DontPayToLarp #FuckJustinSolana

# ⚠️ Bugs

THIS SCRIPT IS NOT PERFECT AND WE WILL NOT FIX IT, DO NOT ASK US FOR SUPPORT.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps money on the real Exodus app.
- Working charts.
- Working transactions.
- Always up-to-date Exodus app.

## 🛠 Install

1. Install [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/download/)
2. Then download the file from our GitHub repo, don't worry it's not ratted. You can check the source code side by side if you want to.
3. Now go to your Exodus, login through a seedphrase that we've leaked before or you can use your own wallet. 
5. From there, press Ctrl + Shift + D and turn on Debug Mode. It should give you developer tools after you restart your wallet.
6. Use either scripts and paste it in Console and press Enter.
7. Go back to your app and pray that it works, because these scripts are insanely unstable if they aren't used through the asar files. (i'm assuming so, i'd try with asar but i don't know how :sob:)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **visual-only LARP**. It does not change your actual balance lol.
Also if you resell this you are a broke no name
